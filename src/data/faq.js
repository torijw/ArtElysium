    question: "How do I get something as a gift?",
    answer: "When filling out your order, you will be given the option to select whether or not it is a gift. If you select 'yes', then you can then provide the name of the person you wish to address the gift to.",

  {
    question: "Can I submit my own designs/drawings?",
    answer: "Of course! We always want our customers to be as creative as they like. You can draw on the canvas we provide on our product pages or upload a file of your own designs in the commission details of the order form.",

    question: "How long will my order take to finish?",
    answer: "The time depends on what your order is and who the artist is, since every artist's process is different. Most digital orders will take 2 weeks up to 5 months, while physical orders will take 1-6 months depending on the difficulty of your commission. If you want a better estimate, feel free to reach out to us and ask.",

  {
    question: "How is shipping handled for physical artworks? How much is the shipping cost?",
    answer: "We sort out the shipping with you privately after your order has been completed where we will confirm the address, courier, and cost with you. This is because shipping will vary depending on the final product and is not consistent even among the same base products. However, you can expect bigger canvases and addresses outside of Canada and the US to be more expensive due to transportation costs. If you want a better estimate before you order, feel free to reach out to us and ask with your specific request details.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will shipping take?",
    answer: "For Canada and US customers, your order will arrive 1-2 weeks after we confirm the shipping information with you. For countries outside of Canada and the US, shipping may take around 1-2 months. We appreciate your patience during this time, thanks.",
